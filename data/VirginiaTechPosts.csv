Please Help Leo Fight Cancer!,https://i.redd.it/3sv6cvii3nve1.jpeg,"Hello everyone

  
I am Abhishek, a grad Hokie. Leo is my 10 year old German Shepherd, who's flown with me from India to live life in the US with me. Unfortunately, we found a mass in his abdomen last Christmas which was surgically removed on Jan 23 2025. Biopsies revealed that he had a rare invasive seminoma, which is highly treatable from research. **The treatment was 5 doses of Carboplatin, and we're already down 3 of those. Each dose is around 800$, totalling 4000$.**

Unfortunately, I'm running short on funds for the last 2 Chemo treatments, 900$ to be exact. So far we've spent close to 10,000$ on surgery, diagnostics and chemo. **Insurance refused to cover every single one of them.** I've raised the money so far from personal funds, family and friends, but my part time nearly doesn't pay enough to cover for the last two doses.

Hence, I am requesting the Hokie community to help Leo and I in the last lap of his cancer treatment! **I am posting the initial GoFundMe I started for him which raised 245$, so I've adjusted the goal for the remaining 900$.**

I’m looking for someone to take over my roommate’s spot in a 2 bed / 2 bath apartment at The HUB Blacksburg for the 2025–2026 school year. Move-in would be sometime in August (exact date depends on the complex’s schedule).

My name is Wynter! I’m a senior majoring in Wildlife Conservation at Virginia Tech \[21, she/her\]. I’m clean, easygoing, and pretty laid-back. I love to cook (happy to share meals if we split groceries if you like!). I play DnD, board games, video games, especially with my roommate who is currently moving out and some other friends. I also enjoy nature, art, etc. I am from Chesapeake, VA, but I am from a military family, so I have traveled a lot. I do enjoy going out, but I am a homebody at heart \[i try to live as drama free and relaxed as I can\].

Some random tips for incoming freshmen,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1k1q29u/some_random_tips_for_incoming_freshmen/,"\- **Do Summer Start if you're not busy**. So essentially ""Summer Start"" is a program that gets you in early (usually July) and you take 1-2 classes and you're also well setup to meet people. If you're not busy, do it. The classes are very easy, and it's a great way to get a head start. It's always crazy how empty campus is in the summer compared to when people arrive in August.

\- **Don't live at Slusher Hall**. It's really a dorm that you'll want to avoid, if you haven't signed up for a dorm yet, don't pick Slusher. Yes it's near the dining halls, but it's very poorly maintained so if you end up on one of the higher floors you'll usually have to wait a while to get to your room (due to one or even both of the elevators consistently being broken). It also flooded a couple years back so it smells like mold, it doesn't have AC, there's roaches everywhere, the rooms are noticeably smaller than those of other dorms, and it looks like a Soviet style hunk of concrete.

\- **Join multiple clubs**. Anyone who's like a junior complaining about how they have no friends is someone who didn't try out clubs, you will have 40,000 fellow Hokies, if you don't make any friends that's on you, clubs are a great way to meet people with similar interests, and there's >1,000 clubs out there to choose from.

\- **If you ever get emails about an** ***entry level high paying sales internship*** **its essentially a scam**. This is worth talking about since I know a lot of freshmen fall for it. So essentially there's a lot of companies that want to hire students as door-to-door salespeople over the summer, and they brand this job as a ""high paying sales internship."" It is not that, or remotely even a resume builder, it is literally just you buying $1000 worth of Cutco knives and trying to sell them.

\- **Go to Waffle House and Cookout**. Not much more to add about this one, I came from up north so I didn't have these growing up, Waffle House and Cookout are peak.

\- **Get an electric bike or scooter**. There is a lot of traffic at Virginia Tech, tens of thousands of people all on the same campus trying to drive to the same buildings; it makes cars slow, it makes the buses slow, it means you can't practically rely on either to get everywhere on time. Further, Virginia Tech is also a big campus, so walking might not always be ideal if you get a class at say Litton Reaves for example. Get an electric bike or scooter, they are without a doubt the fastest way to get around town.

\- **Visit the Blacksburg Community Center (and other town stuff)**. Not enough Hokies get involved with the Blacksburg community, we live in a really cool town. The Blacksburg Community Center hosts a lot of cool stuff, last year I went to a midget wrestling event there, which is exactly what it sounds like (they even had a midget ref). Befriend the townies as well.

\- **Plan to live off-campus in your sophomore year**. Virginia Tech is not designed for everyone to live on campus after freshman year, and having an apartment is objectively better that dorm life in every conceivable way.",93,27,1744930272.0

PSA For Incoming Freshmen - DO NOT JOIN Galipatia!,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1k013yb/psa_for_incoming_freshmen_do_not_join_galipatia/,"\*\*Disclaimer: I am ending with an A, and still feel that this was a terrible experience\*\*  
  
As I reach the end of my freshman year, I am finding that joining the Galipatia LLC was the worst possible choice I could have made for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was by FAR the biggest waste of time I had, with the first semester being taken up by a meeting every single week where we had a kindergarten-style circle where we shared the good, bad and exciting things that happened in our weeks! These meetings are as infantile as they sound. Additionally, something they do not make clear to you at the start is that you have to attend about 20 hours' worth of events, ranging from forced social kahoot sessions to postcard writing. You will be miserable from start to finish if you value your time in any way. If you don't, also keep in mind that this class is NOT an easy A. They will grade your papers (yes, papers) and presentations harshly, they will force you to have multiple verifications of excused absences from class (yes, a weekly class), and they will do essentially all they can to force your grade down. The instructors are NOT on your side, and you will constantly feel like you are fighting against them to keep your grade up. None of this even includes the fact that Pritchard is one of the worst halls on campus. 

I wish I had seen a post like this before I decided to join. I do not know a single person who is happy with the decision they made to join Galipatia, and if you are looking into going to VT for engineering, just pick one of the regular dorms.",229,115,1744746216.0

It’s a top-floor unit, so no noisy neighbors above us. The place has wooden parquet floors, natural light, AC, a balcony, and a super chill vibe. There's a washer and dryer in the building, and the living room is already set up with a couch and a dining table you’re welcome to use. It’s pet-friendly, has parking space, and the neighbors are all super nice and respectful. It’s one of the quietest areas in Blacksburg, which is a rare find.

Location-wise, it’s about a 5-minute walk to the bus stop, 10–15 minutes to Main Street, and around 20 minutes to campus on walking. You’re really close to everything, but the neighborhood still feels peaceful and relaxed.

Utilities are all included except electricity and internet. The good part is that electricity is super cheap, like $20 to $30 a month, because our heating runs on gas.

I’m open to living with anyone; gender and level of study don’t matter to me.

My wife and I just accepted jobs at VT and are very excited to move there this summer. We’re currently in CA where we’ve lived are whole lives, so it will be a big change, but we love everything we’ve seen so far about Blacksburg. 

We are trying to decide when we should look into buying a house in Blacksburg. We’ve rented our whole lives, and can’t wait to settle down and build a family. I’m afraid we are too eager to buy, as most of the advice we’ve heard is to rent for a while to get a feel for the town before buying. So I am looking for any advice on this, specifically:

1) Is it crazy to think about buying a home to move into immediately? Assuming we can only see it for a few days before making our decision?

2) If yes, how long would you recommend renting in Blacksburg before getting a feel for the area and feeling more confident buying a home and putting down roots?

Transferring to VT CS from GMU,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1jyg6i7/transferring_to_vt_cs_from_gmu/,"Hey!

So I got waitlisted at VT this application season for engineering (I want to go into CS), and I'm currently considering my options. I got into GMU, and I was wondering how reasonable it would be for me to try and transfer to VT from GMU after, say, a year or so. I'm aware of the transfer requirements on the website, and that I can take courses specifically aimed towards transferring to VT. Is it particularly difficult to transfer, though? From what I understand it's gotten more competitive recently, and I'm wondering what sort of freshman year GPA and the like would put me in a comfortably confident position that I'd get in as a transfer.

  
Additionally, does it make a difference if I apply as a transfer to VT from an in-state school vs an oos school? I live in NOVA, but I also got into Rutgers for CS, and I may go there instead of GMU. If I did that, I'd still try and transfer after a year, but I'm wondering how different it'd look and whether there'd be any detriment (or perhaps improvement) in chances if I applied from Rutgers as opposed to GMU.

Controversial opinion: is the remembrance run a proper tribute or spectacle?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1jy0b8h/controversial_opinion_is_the_remembrance_run_a/,"I'm not writing this to offend anyone, as I myself have participated in the run in past years, but this year I stood on the sidelines and observed the Run of Remembrance. While maybe not noticeable at first look or first thought, it doesn't represent a proper memorial and appears more like another school spirit event. It's supposed to be about honoring and remembering the 32 lives lost, and yet I wonder how many people actually came out because of them and how many came because it's the ""thing"" to do or the thing their friends were doing.

 Right after the moment of silence, a crowd broke out cheering “Let’s go—Hokies!” like we were kicking off a football game.  The a capella group tech notes sang near the finish line, and I overheard one of them casually ask, “What are they running for again?” That moment especially stuck with me. It was jarring—like, you’re here to perform for this event and you don’t even know why? And maybe that’s the point.

 Maybe we’ve reached a point where the weight of this tragedy is fading from the collective memory. The students who attend this event now were barely toddlers—if even born—when April 16 happened. I’m sure when this event first started, nearly everyone on campus either lost someone or knew someone who did. The grief was raw. The silence was real.

But now? For many, this event seems to have become more of another Hokie spirit tradition than a proper tribute. A community fun run with matching T-shirts, a balloon finish line, and photo ops. A spectacle. At times, it even felt like an act of consumerism.

I just keep thinking about the people who do still come out every year because they did lose someone. Or knew someone. Or were here. What does this feel like for them? Does this still feel like remembrance—or does it feel like everyone else has moved on, turned this into an event rather than a memorial?

For me personally, just reading and thinking in-depth about the event I can't imagine the trauma the students who witnessed it experienced, and can't help but worry that this event has become insensitive and does more harm than good to those affected.
I'd love to hear the opinion of others, especially those who were around when the shooting occurred. Do you think the run for remembrance is still a tribute that properly remembers the lives that were lost?",121,51,1744521406.0

About the protests tonight,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1jw7etm/about_the_protests_tonight/,"From an international student:

I get why you want to protest. But doing so outside burrus changes nothing. Virginia Tech cannot stand in the way of Federal enforcement action as a state university. 

VTPD is not actively assisting federal authorities without warrants or subpoenas and that’s about the limit of “resistance” they can put up.

By encouraging international students to protest, you place them at an even greater risk for SEVIS termination. 

If you really want to see change, take your protest to Richmond or DC. We don’t want your half assed activism on behalf of the international students. It’s just going to bring more scrutiny to our community 


Edit: to everyone comparing this to other protests and saying something is better than nothing 

This is different. We’re painting a target on the backs of at risk students.

There are ways to resist oppression and tyranny that don’t put targets on the backs of people. Those are the ones we must stick to. Social media outrage, putting pressure on our representatives and dialogue. 

Edit 2:

I’m not saying we shouldn’t resist or shouldn’t protest. That’s not the point. The point is that we have other ways to do make change. More impactful ways and ways that do not place targets on the backs of already at risk students. 

Edit 3:

Once again, protesting non existent ICE action and rallying the university, which btw is only doing the bare minimum legally required to cooperate, to be more uncooperative is quite literally protesting without understanding the issue. My problem is not with protests in general. My problem is with this specific (and some previous protests) that have been trying to protest the wrong thing in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Wouldn’t it make more sense to protest unexplained SEVIS terminations? Create an organization that can provide resources and connections? And explain international students their rights? Rather than protest something that’s not happening and potentially cause actual ICE action on campus?

Edit 4:

This basically summarizes my argument

If you want to become President, drop a comment, and you can probably be added on GobblerConnect as our new President within a week. If there's multiple people interested, we usually have two Vice Presidents as well, and other Cabinet roles so there's that. If you're interested, there is really no work actually required for this role until August/September. 

Additionally, if you become President, you will have the full ability to make the club completely your own, you can rename if it you want, you can do literally anything with it (although probably keep it a finance club in some capacity to get support from the alumni).

How much did you show for f1-visa?

It'll take me some more time before getting the whole funding and applying for F-1.

New River Rapids, a local Flyball team, presents the two-day Flyball Tournament titled ""Fools for Flyball"". Flyball is a very fast-paced (and loud) relay race for dogs featuring four dogs on each team. The tournament will feature 20 teams competing and all racing takes place inside the gym of the Blacksburg Community Center. At first glance, Flyball is quite the contract to more traditional obedience based events. Loud with barking dogs and their handlers getting them amped up, it's like attending a rock concert versus a symphony. But don't let the apparent chaos fool you, these dogs are amazing athletes and spend many hours in training and practice. The event is free to spectate, and a food truck will be on site on both Saturday and Sunday. Cabo Fish Taco will be on site on Saturday and the Copper Dog & Co. will be on site on Sunday. Leashed spectator dogs are also welcome.

Is that even allowed for international students? Since my tuition is covered by the RAship, would I have to pay extra tuition for the second major? Also, do I need to go through a full admission process again or can I just register for courses?

Has anyone else noticed how dangerous it is turning onto Webb Street—the road connecting The Edge Apartments and Tech Terrace?

Whenever I bring this up, I hear the same ""there are a lot of new drivers"" and ""oh everyone here is so young, so they don't know how to drive."" Being new to driving does not excuse speeding or charging pedestrians.

I’ve dabbled a little into setting scenes and layout for a render image, but we need to convert our CAD model into a blender model with some texture work and painting, etc. I imported an stl. file into blender but the geometry is in a million polygons and trying to edit the UV and texture made my head spin. Is there any resources on campus or anyone that can help us with this? 

If it is a lot of work to do this, we’re ok with pitching in to compensate. If there’s a blender tutor for free on campus we can also try that too!",2,3,1743665491.0

Even if the concrete wasn't white, putting down that much of it is so incredibly unnecessary. There is a lot of foot traffic that goes through that area, but their solution is the pinnacle of laziness. I don't think I even have to talk about how ugly it is.

**How it works:**

* **Drivers** : Post rides you’re offering (e.g., trips to campus, grocery runs, weekend adventures).
* **Riders** : Browse open seats and request to join.
* **No paywall** – it’s 100% free

**Why try it?**

* Avoid parking headaches or pricey Ubers.
* Make friends during your commute!
* Support a local VT student’s side project.

**Current state:**

* The UI is *functional but basic* (think 2007 vibes, sorry).
* Backend is still a work in progress (please be patient!).
* **No ads, no tracking** – just a barebones app.

**I need YOUR help:**

1. Test the app: [https://compassionate-nurturing-production.up.railway.app/rides](https://compassionate-nurturing-production.up.railway.app/rides)

**Let me know if you actually get a ride** – I’d love to celebrate the first successful match! 🎉

Been here 3 years and honestly the quality has gone down, the prices have gone up, and now their customer service just gives you the most worthless excuse of compensation for not holding up to what they tell you you’re paying for. Like- 10% off of the cost of your ticket in the form of a coupon for another ride is just saying “f u and your horrible experience where the AC was broken, you didn’t have the amenities we ‘guarantee’, and the bus smelled like 💩 for the majority of the 4 hours. We expect you’ll spend money with us again anyways b*tch.” 

It’s cheaper and more comfortable to get a ride from someone going the same direction or use smart way to get to Amtrak for the train. You can take a train up to NOVA to the metro, and the metro basically puts you wherever in NOVA is closest to you. Sure you go on 2-3 different things, but altogether it’s cheaper than OurBus, it’s more reliable, and ffs I’m sick and tired of OurBus being an absolute 💩 pile that EXPECTS to get all our business.

Rapidly alternating stillness and eruptive movement are intersected by extreme physicality and exquisitely detailed and nuanced choreographies of flying, balancing, and landing. A groundbreaking work of intense power, Opus is a melding of music and bodies at the highest level.

IP law course and pathways for Fall 2025,https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/academics/stl.html,"Fall  courses in copyrights,  patents, and trademarks 

Interested in learning more about patents/trademarks/copyrights and need pathways courses? Sometimes these courses fly under the radar and I like to make sure they are noticed, especially as more and more industries rely on different areas of IP law. 

You do not have to declare the STL minor to take the courses. You do not have to plan to go to law school or be in a science  or engineering major to take the classes, they are open and accessible to all colleges, majors, and backgrounds. For fall courses we have STL 2304 Foundations of STL (Pathways 3 CRN 90299) and 4324 Global Aspects of IP (Pathways 2 CRN 90301) with no need for prior STL classes. Or if you have taken a course before we have STL 4304 IP Law (CRN 90300). 

There is no requirement to finish the minor if you take the classes. But it is pretty straightforward if you want the minor as it is a pathways minor.

If you have questions about the classes or law school or IP law or whatever, reach out to out STL division leader here! Go Hokies!",0,0,1743176775.0

College is a time for new experiences and sometimes people want to do things that clubs have or do but clubs are grounded, for some experienced people, or too much commitment. This club would have a different theme every meeting, low commitment, just come when you want to try something new, have fun without the stakes of an experienced club, or even try to find out if a club is for you. The club could partner with clubs, various organizations, and independent projects. For example:

- Never Have I Ever .. volunteered with or for [example] and we could reach out to the red cross, animal shelters, or even vt service clubs. It would be hands on of course

- Never Have I Ever .. made pottery, did caligraphy, painted a model - just random art projects or crafts (could even partner with art clubs for this or an independent event)

- Never Have I Ever .. made [insert meal, dish, food) - could partner with the bake clubs or cooking clubs or be an independent event

I don’t know could give people a chance to explore clubs with low commitment or decompress or just have fun doing something random or something they enjoy without fully committing to a club. Just an idea though haha!

I was shopping for bike locks for a high-end ebike used for commuting to campus and around Blacksburg. I noticed that all but the best locks ($200-300 locks) can be destroyed within seconds by an angle grinder. 

I was wondering if this type of attack is common for thieves on campus/around Blacksburg. 

I noticed most students use basic cable or u locks which can be cut by large bolt cutters and grinders, so I am assuming that most thieves are just criminals of opportunity and steal bikes that aren't locked up at all. 

That said I believe I should be fine with a 10/10 gold security u-lock that isn't as pricey as the angle grinder resistant ones but please let me know if you have known of any thefts with angle grinder attacks. ",11,13,1743093107.0

For anyone who doesn't understand the Slusher/Student Life Village situation,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1jhe6ja/for_anyone_who_doesnt_understand_the/,"* CMG Leasing, [widely known for its predatory practices,](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cmg-leasing-blacksburg-blacksburg-2) is the effective off-campus housing hegemon in Blacksburg that [owns 15 apartment complexes](https://www.cmgleasing.com/office/downtown-blacksburg/) (the Edge, Tech Terrace, Chasewood to name a few)
* [The CEO and president of CMG Leasing is Jeanne Stosser](http://campusmgmtgroup.com/about/leadership/)
* In July 2024, [Jeanne Stosser was appointed to the Board of Visitors](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/07/bov-2024-appointees.html), the body that is empowered to select the president, faculty, determine salaries, handle all matters of student life, and is responsible for all property of the university
* Not even a year later, it was revealed that the Board of Visitors [now intends to rescind the decision made in 2022 to demolish Slusher Tower and instead """"""renovate"""""" it. More importantly, they also intend to stop all funding going towards the Student Life Village](https://bov.vt.edu/assets/Materials-March%2024-25,%202025-36.pdf) (page 154), which had an [end goal of providing 5,000 beds](https://bceva.com/virginia-tech-board-approves-19-5-million-for-planning-of-student-life-village/).

So the decision to build more (potentially) affordable housing for students on campus is now, coincidentally, being scrapped right after the CEO of the biggest housing provider in Blacksburg was put on the board, the same board that previously approved the measure. I'm sure you can see why this is abhorrently wrong for a multitude of reasons. This also isn't because the University is now strapped for cash because of the whole federal grant decision. They made [417 million dollars in net profit last year (page 3), and hold 216 million dollars in cash and cash equivalent assets (page 20).](https://www.controller.vt.edu/content/dam/controller_vt_edu/resources/financialreporting/financialstatements/FY24_Financial_Report_web.pdf) The 19.5 million they allocated to the Student Life Village is a drop in the bucket.

**DISCLAIMER: MY OPINION BELOW** (feel free to disagree) (not factual information like the above text)

What can you do about this?

You can protest the Board of Visitors all you want, but I can personally assure you that they, and the rest of the leadership at this University, ***do not give a shit about you or your opinion***. Protesting with signs outside their building probably makes them happier that they're making the lives of students worse. They care solely about money... so do things that make them less money:

* Don't donate after you graduate (not sure why people would even do this anyways).
* Tell prospective VT students your *honest opinion* about the university, and encourage them to actually read the criticism and not just the shill reviews. I've convinced 6 people to not come here by doing this. Even if we're being generous, that's 6 people \* $15,000/year \* 4 years = **$360,000** that the university missed out on solely from one person's actions.",219,86,1742665672.0

Both musicians have carved a name for themselves in the regional and national music scene and are now taking their collaborative efforts to a new level. The Red Ferns are a five-piece Blacksburg, VA based rock band. They enjoy covering songs by The Eagles, The Allman Brothers, and The Grateful Dead. The Ferns have mainly been a cover band, but they are working on developing their own sound as well.

The frog Hunt,https://i.redd.it/o2npwbwsjhpe1.jpeg,"Sup fellow Hokies!

I just wanted to share a little adventure I went on recently that turned out to be one of the most memorable experiences during my time here in Blacksburg. It all started with some aimless wandering, and before we knew it, we were deep into an epic quest to find 16 hidden frog statues scattered across town. Sounds random? Oh, it was—but trust me, it was worth every second.

So, let’s rewind a bit. A few weeks ago, my friend and I had a lazy day with absolutely nothing planned (we’ve all been there). On a whim, we hopped on a bus in the evening and decided to do some shop hopping downtown. Now, this is where things got interesting. While exploring, we stumbled into what we thought was a plant shop—only to realize later it was actually High Supply , a weed store. Oops! We spent some time browsing around, pretending we knew what we were doing, and then awkwardly left. Little did we know this was just the warm-up for what was coming next.

On our way back, as we crossed a bridge, we spotted something unusual—a frog sitting there. At first glance, we genuinely thought it was alive (cue instant panic). My brave (or maybe foolish?) friend decided to poke it, only to discover it was a statue. Weird, right? But we laughed it off and kept walking.

Fast forward to winter break when things were pretty dead around campus. My friends and I would hang out at Coffeeholics, trying to get work done—or at least pretending to. I’m not great at focusing when people are around, so naturally, I suggested another round of “shop hopping.” Yeah, yeah, I know, super exciting stuff. But hey, we were bored, and Miami trip prep could wait.

During one of these outings, I took them to The Alexander Black House on Draper Road—a cool little museum spot that’s definitely worth checking out if you haven’t already. As we were leaving, we noticed a poster about the 16 frog statues hidden throughout Blacksburg. And just like that, the idea hit us: Why not make it our mission to find them all?

Here’s where the story gets fun. One of my friends jokingly said, “If I land an internship at FAANG, we’re going on a frog hunt.” Well… guess who landed that internship?! True to his word, he called me at 11:30 PM one night and said, “Let’s go now.” Naturally, I was down. Who doesn’t love a late-night escapade?

Now, a quick disclaimer: Some of these frogs are located in some shady parts of town. Seriously, don’t try this alone at night unless you want to feel like you’re starring in your own horror movie. But armed with flashlights and questionable decision-making skills, we set off.

The first frog we found was named ‘Keister.’ Honestly, finding it gave us such a rush of joy—it felt like we were onto something big. The scariest moment came when we were searching for ‘Virginia’ around 1 AM. The area was pitch black, no streetlights, and honestly, we half-expected someone to yell at us for trespassing or worse. Spoiler alert: No one shot us, but it was still terrifying.

By the end of Day 1, we’d tracked down 11 frogs. The remaining 5 were saved for the next day. Let me tell you, the thrill of wandering through unfamiliar streets at night, combined with the fear of getting lost or caught, made the whole experience unforgettable. Some parts of town looked downright eerie after dark, and I have no idea how students live in those areas without constant paranoia.

Day 2 was much more relaxed since we weren’t racing against the clock. Our final frog was ‘Bogen,’ and standing there, having completed the collection, felt oddly satisfying. Sure, it sounds silly, but there’s something magical about exploring new corners of a place you thought you knew well. Beyond the usual TOTS and downtown spots, Blacksburg has so many hidden gems waiting to be discovered.

For anyone reading this who’s stuck in a rut or just looking for something different to do, grab a buddy and embark on your own frog-finding adventure. It might sound boring on paper, but trust me—the journey itself is what makes it special. Plus, it’ll give you a fresh appreciation for how quirky and charming this town really is.

Anyway, that’s enough rambling from me for today. If you’ve gone on any weird or unexpected adventures lately, drop them in the comments—I’d love to hear about them!

How can I get better?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1jdzyf4/how_can_i_get_better/,"Hi, I'm a general engineering freshman (trying to go mechanical).

I feel like I’ve really bummed out my first two semesters here, and it’s starting to weigh on me. My GPA took a hit after a rough first semester, so I tried to balance it out by taking some easier GPA boost classes in the spring. But now I feel like I’ve fallen behind on the core classes I actually need for my major.

I had to withdraw from Linear Algebra last semester after bombing the second midterm, which pushed me even farther back. This semester, I ended up dropping Statics after doing poorly on the first test. Now I’m trying to catch up by taking physics online at a community college and planning to do the same with math classes over the summer.

I’ve tried to put myself out there — I joined a few clubs and interviewed for some design teams but I got rejected from them. Now that I’m applying for internships, it’s a similar story: I manage to get interviews, but I keep getting rejected afterward. I have some previous internship experience and a few solid projects on my resume, so I guess the issue is with how I’m handling the interviews.

I guess I’m starting to feel pretty lost. I know I still have time to get back on track, but right now it feels like I’m digging myself into a deeper hole. Has anyone been in a similar spot and managed to turn things around? How did you rebuild your confidence and get back on track with your academics and career plans?

Any advice would really help — I’m open to anything at this point.",14,5,1742285184.0

I’m sorry in advance if anything I say is wrong, I’m still trying to understand all of the costs. 

I have around $80k in my 529 (college savings account) but tuition this year is $43k and my 529 won’t get me super far. Tech didn’t offer any extra aid and FAFSA didn’t either. Is there anybody I can contact that may be able to drop the costs lower? Are there any scholarships I may be able to apply for? I’ve applied for 20-30 scholarships but I don’t know how many are reliable or if I’ll win any of them. Are there any types of loans I should avoid? 

The thought of being stuck paying off debts from college for the rest of my life is scary and I’m hoping to do everything I can so I can at least say I did my best.

The fact that the heads of our town are trying to say the new construction of 700 some apartments is for the good of the area is absurd. It's a massive Petco animal cage style complex aimed at one thing, making more money off of new students. Instead of attempting to regulate Virginia Techs addiction with adding more and more to an already over run town, we are being pushed aside for the almighty dollar and the illusion of progress. This area has already been turned into a doormat for the wave of students that offer almost nothing for the town yet take whatever they want. The students are getting worse every year. They aren't policed properly, the athletes literally get away with murder, and the staff is a sespool. They've said new development will help students get housing earlier instead of having to wait almost 9 months for something to open up, but what about the residents living here year round?! What about the insanity that will become the become the daily traffic flow? It's already becoming too expensive for annual residents to continue to reuse here, so let's add even more for the people of Blacksburg to pay for. Enough is enough. We are tired of babysitting your kids while they destroy this town and make it impossible to afford living expenses. Stand up to these tyranical money mongers and keep them from further crippling this beautiful town. Staff and town official's bonuses and more room for kids going to a school they won't graduate from, studying for a degree they can't use, in a place where no one wants them, isn't worth it in almost every way.

1. How long does it take to generate the VT email? I have my address and password, but cannot figure out how to actually access the email. So far everything is saying that my account doesn't exist. 

2. What are the most essential action items for newly admitted students before the start of the fall semester? 

3. Are there any promising fellowships or grant opportunities for DC-based students who cannot receive instate tuition?
