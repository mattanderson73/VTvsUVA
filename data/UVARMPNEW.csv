3.3,"overrated, overpriced, snobby, but clean & the professors are devoted to students. 5/10"
4.3,food bad
4.7,"Best school in the world. I feel so grateful to be here every time I walk through Grounds. My favorite aspect is the work hard, play hard culture. Everyone here is an academic weapon, but knows how to have fun. "
5.0,"UVA is something truly special. Nestled in the heart of Charlottesville, it's surrounded by a town that's as welcoming as it is beautiful. Its mountain views and sense of community make it the perfect place to learn and grow. Students are challenged with top-tier academics while also embracing a vibrant social scene and a proud athletic tradition."
5.0,Very nice 
5.0,"Honestly, UVA is a paradise for me. I never knew I would love college as much as I've loved it here. I'm so sad to be graduating this spring."
4.6,LOVE UVA but the food needs so much work. Use the same food provider that Runk uses at the other 2 dining halls.
4.0,UVA is a great school!
4.2,It is the best place in the whole world; I am so thankful to go here. 
4.1,"I'm a transfer student but I would say coming to uva was one of the best decisions I've ever made. It's not perfect, but I've had fun and experiences here that I don't regret."
4.3,"Great experience through four years, friendly environment and plenty of opportunities."
4.5,definitely one of the schools of all time
4.5,definitely one of the schools of all time
4.3,"This was my dream school growing up and I have to say that it lived up to every expectation I had. It's competitive, but not in a bad way. The professors are great and really passionate about the subjects they teach. Not that it's perfect- no college is- but I've found lifelong friends and I wouldn't want to go anywhere else."
4.5,"It's not cheap at all for an out-of-state student, but it is worth every dollar. Everyone is very nice and supportive, and the social scene is great. Honestly, the only downsides are food and football, and everything past that is pretty solid. "
1.0,Don't come here for undergrad or any of the graduate schools. This is not a good place for your mental health.
3.3,"UVA is definitely over hyped and costs way too much for out of state students. Personally, I don't think the costs justify out of state, but in state makes some sense because at least your paying a little less. The engineering department is okay, but could definitely use a lot of improvement, and the math/science departments are awful. "
4.6,"The best school ever! Coolest location, gorgeous campus, amazing social opportunities, great academics, and fun sports. We get a bad reputation for being preppy and stuck up, but it's nowhere close to as bad as some make it seem. The food gets a lot of hate because it isn't ~amazing~ but it's totally fine and you'll find things you like. Go here!"
3.9,"I love this school, its a perfect mix of great opportunities, amazing professors, and a beautiful campus"
5.0,LOVE
4.4,No space for 2025 students but its awesome here.
4.5,Love UVA its awesome my cousin Mariah graduated from her 2 years ago and she loved it so do I its amazing campus
4.3,I like it at UVA its an awesome experience Im a sophomore this year at UVA and its awesome and my cousin Tatum is also here shes a Freshman and she also loves it here
2.6,"Decent reputation and location. I definitely recommend exploring off grounds. The environment is very competitive, so clubs and opportunities are not guaranteed (for decent ones at least). Everything is under construction or outdated. WiFi sucks. Literally got food poisoning at the dining halls. CAPS is so incredibly ineffective."
3.5,"Lots of clubs here, but it's hard to find them; not easy to meet people unless you do. The research/internship scene is VERY competitive but fruitful. Wifi is mostly stable. Many aren't loving it, but party to cope. Lots of stalking/prowling/assault incidents here, unfortunately. Overall, promising, but you have to work to have a good experience."
2.9,I went here to be close to family instead of Notre Dame. Worst decision of my life.
4.0,"I really like it, hard to make close friends at first but it all works out in the end plus there is A LOT of school spirit from current students and alums."
4.4,"always stuff to do both on and off grounds. dining food is terrible but cville has an excellent restaurant scene so branch out. profs are helpful, grading is hard but its a hard school. good time management and study skills are a must. its a big school so definitely get involved w clubs and put yourself out there"
4.5,great location with lots of things to do. teachers are pretty great and overall the students are happy. food could use some improvement
5.0,Love this school more than anything!
4.4,"You won't be special here like you were in high school. Learning is a job. Take the time to study studying. Really. Go on YouTube to find tricks, be critical of your own study habits, ask friends. Study smarter, not longer. Become an efficient student so you can make the most of all the great social opportunities. Work hard, play hard. GO HOOS."
4.7,uva is the best
4.2,"Even though my first semester has been restricted due to COVID-19, it has been AMAZING. If you are worried about the prestigious reputation of UVA, please don't be. The majority of people here are fantastic and inclusive. The food is okay but take advantage of meal exchanges. If you want a work hard, play hard environment, UVA is your school."
4.7,I love the school.
4.9,BEST experience of your life
4.5,"I don't do Greek life , but I hangout with friends so I don't see social as a problem Professors don't reach out to you. But if you reach out to them a lot, then they give you lots of opportunities. I got to do RA for different professors because I know them well Location is good if you love a quiet life, but def no city vibe here Love the Castle"
1.3,"I hate it here. I am so glad I get to transfer to William and Mary in the Fall. Everyone at UVA is either stuck up, racist, or totally anti-social. Half of the people here are addicted to alcohol or crack. Plus, the classes are too hard for no reason. Professors don't care about you, and you will be treated like a number. I do not recommend."
3.0,Every community college class I have taken has been better taught than UVA. Do yourself a favor and go to an undergrad focused liberal arts college for undergrad.
4.7,"Best school, don't miss out"
4.4,I love it here! It's big enough to have something for everyone yet small enough to feel like a cohesive community. I found my place very quickly and I miss it when I'm gone. Wahoowa!
4.4,"A beautiful campus where everyone has a lot of school pride. The food is terrible, but only in the dining halls."
4.1,"On Grounds, I feel the happiest and most at home"
4.2,"I love UVA! Great schools with good people and fun social life and sports! The worst thing about uva is probably how competitive everything is, you literally need to apply to just be in any club, and Greek life is very exclusive and shallow."
3.9,"Bar none a gorgeous historical campus, wonderful opportunities, and great people."
4.0,"Food varies day to day. Sometimes it is pretty decent, but sometimes it really is just straight awful. WiFi is iffy sometimes and just goes out for no reason."
3.5,"I have always wanted to attend UVA, but when I got accepted and was excited to start my journey there, the Virginia Status office was very racist and discriminatory against me. I did not feel heard and they kept discouring me from attending UVA. In the beginning, I wouldn't give up, but then I hated everything about that school."
4.4,"UVA is incredibly beautiful, it has amazing opportunities and very good teachers. It would be good if they got rid of SIS and replaced it with something more useful, and if they put a leash on their greek life, but thats pretty much it."
3.9,UVA is a really good school and I love going here. The food is not as bad as people make it out to be though the wifi is kinda bad. Overall tons of school spirit (NCAA champs baby) and if you're careful who you go out with it has a great party scene.
4.6,Amazing
2.4,"Beautiful campus and city, but the people here are surprisingly pretentious and uppity even towards other schools. I loved the academic rigor but the people here weren't my taste."
3.5,"While UVA is well known and the name alone will get you far, if you aren't a rich kid from NOVA you will be out of place. There are lots of activities and opportunities, but the entire school has a gatekeeper mentality about involvement. If you don't have a cover letter and a trust fund, you probably won't enjoy your time here."
3.7,"Very fun and academically focused school. Sports are a big thing and there are a lot of traditions. There are many opportunities for research, and professors are generally kind. The student culture is a bit pretentious, but you can definitely find your people if you try. Grounds are picturesque and c'ville is a fun town! Happy that I chose UVA"
4.7,best school in the world
4.1,"In general, it's a good university."
4.2,"Work hard, play hard. Gorgeous grounds, great community"
4.1,"I've loved classes, my clubs, and volunteer work. Grounds is beautiful. However, UVa can be cliquey, centered on greek life/going to bars. If you're shy/got partying out of your system in high school UVA might not be for you, socially. There's def a subset unhappy students bc of the social scene."
4.1,I love it here
4.1,"Only reason anyone could be unhappy here is because academics are HARD! Work hard, play hard mentality. Study all week so that you can party all weekend."
4.0,"I love UVA but it can be a stressful environment. However, the value of the education is definitely worth the challenging aspects. I have also made some really great friends here, and people in the community are very amazing."
4.4,Best school you could ever go to
4.1,Cool.
4.2,"Food sucks, everything else is pretty cool."
4.3,I am proud of being a student here.
4.1,I love it.
4.9,Best decision I've ever made!!
5.0,I love this college
4.8,"Best Univerisity in VA, hands down. If you're looking for the best all around University, UVA is the place to be."
4.8,The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and I couldnt have wished for a better place to get my degree.
4.8,Beautiful school with top notch academics. Haven't met anyone who doesn't like it here.
3.0,Professors are great and generally enthusiastic!
4.6,UVA is the best school in Virginia and probably the country. Amazing academics with an even better social life. 10/10 would recommend!
4.9,"Best school on Earth, everyone loves it here and those who have graduated all want to come back."
4.5,Great School with not so great food
3.9,"Nothing more to say, really. I love UVa."
4.5,Love UVA!
4.0,"UVA is definitely the best decision I have ever made. (But don't fall into the trap of thinking because you were an all-star in HS, that it will be the same here.) Phenomenal school and Cville is my favorite place in the world with a diverse food, culture, art, music, everything scene, but some think it a bit smaller than they would like. Wahoowa!!"
3.8,"The campus is beautiful, however the classes are way too big and the food is pretty bad. Greek life is available and students normally go out a lot; some people are nice but others tend to stay in their cliques. Classes can also be challenging and demanding."
4.0,"The Rotunda (and grounds in general) is (are) beautiful. Classes are hard, but worthwhile and very interesting. Students are generally very nice and accepting. So many clubs to choose from, everyone can find their place. Greek life is available but not overwhelming. Food is average. Athletics are fun. Overall, I can't imagine myself anywhere else."
4.1,The academics at UVA are top-notch. Students receive a private school education for the price of a public school. The professors are amazing and the students are all brilliant and respectful individuals.
3.9,"Love it here, perfect fit for me. No school is perfect. Food is eh but there are so many opportunities."
3.6,"Very competitive , bad food, HOWEVER- social life is great with bar and greek scene so everybody has a place, academically a great institution,. Definitely not the happiest college because everyone is so stressed out, but that happens at any tough school. If you want to sacrifice prestige for happiness go to Tech (they are happier there not a dig)"
4.1,Really appreciate my four years here.
3.5,"The school promotes competition and it can be harmful at times. Clubs are very exclusive and friend groups are very cliquish. Administration has no patience for transfer students, good luck if you are one and don't back down from your goals bc these people will try to make you."
3.5,"Parties are not that lit. Very competitive environment. Clubs are extremely exclusive, some classes as well, and the students perpetuate an air of superiority more so as a competition against each other not really to outsiders. Still a great school but it has it's flaws."
4.1,wahoowa- shannon's the best dorms
3.2,"UVA, no doubt, has an excellent reputation academically, but, as with many campuses, it has its issues.  Visit ""grounds"" multiple times, but only take the tour once.  The tours are, as with all university tours, bs.  Talk to as many students as possible, sit in on lectures, and even spend a Friday night if you're able to."
4.6,.Great school
4.6,This University is well known and has a reputable sports program as well as a great set of student- driven to make good grades and have a social life. The dorms are very nice and the bus system is here if you don't want to walk somewhere.
4.0,"UVA is very much what you make it. Anything is possible and open to those who want it. The food is annoying some days, but honestly it's not horrible"
3.8,"UVa has a long history and an excellent reputation. The facilities are exceptional (if consistently under renovation) and school Grounds are picturesque. The administration is very helpful and the professors are peerless. The student body is collectively wanting and there are diversity issues, but it's a good school. Overall, I'm quite satisfied."
4.1,UVA Rocks
2.4,"STAY AWAY!!  Grounds are historic and incredibly beautiful, however the students and professors leave MUCH to be desired.  They are NOT the least bit helpful; scheduling time to meet is impossible.   Virtually all of them seem to think they are somehow superior to everyone else for some unjustifiable reason... and the students are 10x WORSE!!"
3.5,"Overall, UVA is a great school: it's definitely well respected in academia and in the job market, the campus (grounds) is beautiful, and there are a variety of opportunities and resources available.  The university, through its professors, deans, and students, really feels smaller than it is, so don't be put off by its size."
3.1,"-good teachers, even if class sizes can be large -expansive grounds that are fun to explore -lots of activities to join -students study hard, study floors of libraries are often full in the evening -difficult to fit in if you aren't into the party scene -large university, can get lost in the crowd, people tend to be less friendly and form cliques"
3.9,"UVA- Work hard, play hard. Beautiful  area."
4.1,"Love UVA. For me, having a predominantly student run campus is huge. That means that clubs, student government, and student-faculty relationships are largely students facilitated. This provides real world experience to students (including myself) in management, finance, cooperation, marketing, and basically anything else they want to explore."
4.1,"I love attending the University of Virginia! It's academically rigorous, has a wonderful reputation, and is definitely the best school in Virginia."
4.1,"UVA is truly a work-hard play-hard school. There is a lot of nightlife for all types of people, even non-drinkers.  Charlottesville has a lot to do and the town has amazing food; it's just the on-campus food that sucks. The sampling truck is UVA dining's redemption. You will truly love where you're living no matter what type you get (@CDF)."
4.0,"I love UVA! The Grounds are beautiful (a UNESCO world heritage site), and the social scene is lit no matter what you're into, whether it's bars, greek life, CIO parties, as well as many non-party student events. Everyone loves the basketball team, so student tickets are highly competitive. The food can be hit or miss, but is also underrated."
3.9,"I love this place! So many amazing people who constantly support you  to do what you really want to do. I am a student from China and was not used to be in a place where people are mostly Virginians, but people I met here are nice. Felted empowered by classmates from my philosophy class and wash society! UVa is also very respected by local people."
2.0,Needs work on a lot of things but still a decent school
3.9,"UVA is great, so glad I got in!"
3.6,A great university with reasonable tuition
3.8,UVA is the best.  Not to mention the Lawn is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You can literally do your homework on a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
3.7,"UVA is a fantastic university and provides a lot of opportunities.  Depending on the department, there are world-renowned professors who are willing to serve undergrads and grads equally.  In my opinion, the school is not that preppy at all. Either way, there are tons of social groups on grounds, so you'll be able to find what you want."
4.1,"It was super hard for me to choose what college to go to. I finally decided on UVA, and haven't regretted it ever. There are so many resources available, so many helpful people, and so many opportunities. Also not everyone, me included, find the need to party or drink so there is niche for everyone."
4.3,Amazing!
3.2,"UVa no doubt has tremendous programs and its top students are extremely talented and of high intellect. Many UVa graduates go on to the best corporations and the best graduate schools in the United States, and prove to be leaders within organizations of all kinds. The U, however, should consider go private to maintain its prestige esp v. other u's."
4.5,Best university in the country.
4.3,"Being a Cavalier (or WAHOO) is more than just an identity, it is a way of life.  Because of it's uniqueness and deep traditions, you will quickly realize how special it is.  It is truly a work hard, play hard school: full of geniuses who knows how to party.  As a well respected University, having UVa on your resume is sure to impress employers!"
4.2,Wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
3.9,Love it here and couldn't be happier with my choice of university!
3.9,I LOVE LOVE LOVE UVA. I am a first year student and I am so extremely happy with all the friendships I have created as well as the activities both planned by the school such as the BEAUTIFUL lighting of the lawn as well as clubs such as Hillel or Madison House. :)
4.5,best school ever
3.8,"I am so happy here, and I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else.  If you are up for a challenge academically as well as a fun social experience, UVA is the place for you!  WAHOOWA!"
4.2,So insanely happy
4.3,Believe the hype.
4.3,Great school. Work is challenging and night life is rewarding. Everyone is attractive and loves their school. Great sports atmosphere and student spirit. People here care.
4.1,"I'm currently in my third-year here at UVA and love this University, the people here, the campus culture, and the Charlottesville area. Couldn't have picked a better college for myself. Will be sad to let this place go when I graduate. WAHOOWA"
3.7,"Great place. Love it here, never want to leave."
