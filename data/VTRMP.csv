Review
"Couldn't be a more perfect school for me. I love the big state school feel in a small college town. There is infinite access to resources and opportunities, it's just up to you to take advantage of them."
this place is perfect
Best decision of my life go hokies
love it
"Great school all around. Have loved my experience here so much. So many opportunities to better yourself, earn a great degree, find jobs after college, and become a well rounded person. They want you to succeed. "
"I love the location, I grew up in a rural town so this is a wonderful place for me! Everything is great, and the only things I think could be improved are not feasible to do, like reduce the number of hills on campus :)"
Awesome school; engineering is definitely tough though and has its reputation for a reason 
"Wondertful quaint little instutition, Jolly good show!"
really quite good
I absolutely love My School and couldn't see myself anywhere else. 
"Food is amazing (but a little expensive). Internet isn't great, especially in some of the older dorms. I feel pretty safe on campus"
i love it here so much
Good. Good food. Lots of walking. Large campus that consists of giant hills so be prepared to walk. Recommend bringing a bike or electric scooter to get up those hills. All classes are a minimum of 10 min walk up hill BE PREPARED 
"The school is amazing. Teachers are exceptional, classes are challenging but resources are great, safety is decent but there are police everywhere, food is immaculate (expensive though), clubs are fun (go to clubs when making friends). I would HIGHLY recommend going to weeks of welcome events to get friends and feel more connected to virginia tech!"
Great
Great school with lots of opportunities especially if you want to study engineering
"Goated school. #1 public school in Virginia, 6th in the country. Need I say more? GO HOKIES."
"The food is absolutely AMAZING!! 
I haven't really been to many of the clubs so I'm a little iffy on that but everything else is pretty high up there. Only thing is the WiFi is rough "
LOVE
its the best.
best school ever
"Virginia Tech has something for everyone. It's big but feels small - like I always see friends when changing classes. Blacksburg is super homey and the nature surrounding it is AMAZING. Hiking spots, waterfalls, river swimming, bonfires, camping, is all within reach. I feel very safe on campus. It's 10/10 vibes, I don't even have to romanticize it"
Amazing
"Virginia Tech is incredible! I am going into my junior year at tech and my experience so far has been absolutely amazing. I am so thankful for this school, the clubs, the people I have met, and the opportunities I have been presented. I highly recommend this school and forever proud to be a HOKIE! "
This school is a great public university with a lot of opportunities open for all mayors. It is ranked very highly and is very reputable as well.
"Vt has an amazing rep,a diverse and balanced school, location is in the middle of nowhere, infinite opportunities, not enough facilities and common areas, great internet, 11/10 food, more than enough clubs, a diverse and balanced student population 11/10 social, location is not best so happiness goes down over time, safe place."
"dorm = 100 yr old shoebox
dining = many options+1/2 off with meal plan
professors = mostly helpful with a couple of outliers
on-campus parking for residents = 1 mile away from dorm
"
"Overall, Virginia Tech is a great environment to learn and make connections. "
"Fantastic school, saying I enjoyed my time there is an understatement. The quality of education it provides relative to the cost (at least in state) is hard to beat. You do have to be slightly proactive in seeking out office hours for large classes if you need help, but I never had difficulty getting assistance if I put the effort in. "
Fantastic campus - Really happy student body
"This school is just an amazing place to be. Hardly anybody I've met is rude, there are lots of working and academic opportunities, and social life is great. The teachers are good for the most part too"
"Amazing school, feel wrong to give anything a 4. VT is a 2nd home "
"Blacksburg is home!! Engineering opportunities - research, design team, WARE Lab - are unparalleled!"
VT students care abt 2 things - football and greek life. don't come if u don't like the country vibe
"Virginia Tech and Blacksburg, VA is an awesome combo - go hokies!"
I've personally had such a great experience. I had a bit of a tough time the first month freshman year because I'm not a super outgoing person and didn't know anyone but once I pushed myself to get out there and joined some clubs everything really turned around for me and I knew I made the best choice coming to VT. I also love Blacksburg in itself!
It's a pretty good school.
I have loved my time at Virginia Tech so far!! There are so many diverse opportunities on campus and in Blacksburg to explore.
"Great place to be, go hokies"
pretty good place to be. go hokies!
"My only complaint would be the location cause it is a bit far from large cities but at the same time that's a highlight. The campus is great, and the sense of community is definitely present. Cafeterias can be packed at peak hours but the food isn't that bad. Would definitely recommend it!"
i love tech! GOKIES
It's an awesome environment! 
"I'm in VT's Mechanical Engineering Graduate program, which is a great program, but if you're looking for really 
top-shelf ambitious universities like Purdue, UMich, Penn State etc., it's probably a rung below that.
Social life is great for in-campus activities... but its location (Blacksburg, VA) is pretty remote, so not much to do outside campus."
i don't feel like elaborating but GO HOKIES (the wifi sucks tho)
"Don't trust the Wi-Fi it doesn't work 90% of the time, you also have no service. "
"The city is built around the school so the everything in Blacksburg feels like it is apart of the school. Because everything is close and tight, you will get to know every local small business in here. The benefits you get is pretty solid too and had pretty good overall experience with the school. "
Pretty solid overall
yes
"Blacksburg is honestly the perfect balance between peaceful and energetic. From my experience, the Engineering Expo is a strong way to network with the some of the best companies and to land different internships. Choosing VT was definitely one of my best decisions.
Go Hokies!"
"Wonderful food, amazing campus, and social atmosphere! The university is great."
"Great school, was not planning on going but in the end I have loved it."
"This school is the absolute best way to spend your four years in college. The foods amazing, there are countless study spots, our sports teams have really good crowds (even if they aren't playing so well), great club sports, easy to get involved in any of our countless clubs, greek life isn't overpowering just supplementary, and it bburgs gorgeous"
The School is very great and it's easy to socialize with people. It's easy to make friends as well.  I love Virginia Tech. I am happy that I choose to go there. 
"I love VT. The campus' size and variety of food options really helped me to live a healthy lifestyle. There are hundreds of clubs, many greek organizations, and tons of rec sports and activities to participate in. There is literally something for everyone at VT, you just have to look around a little to find what you are looking for. GOKIES!
"
"Great for STEM, great campus, and great community."
"A lot of opportunities are available! VT opened so many doors for me career-wise. Also, a fun school to be at!"
its the bomb 
Many opportunities to find for interests and careers.
"Love Virginia Tech! The professors are very passionate about what they teach, and they really try to get to know each student on a personal level. The internet is not the best, but the atmosphere makes up for it! #GOKIES ?"
"Great school! I love the location, coming from a small town where everything is spaced out this is a great location for a college town, everything you could need is super close in either Blacksburg or Christiansburg. 
The internet is HORRIBLE working on campus is almost impossible. I do wish they were better to transfer students."
"I'm a Comp Science student and the internet can be pretty bad sometimes, which is really annoying for me. Other than that, this school is amazing!"
"Well-respected school especially for engineering, great food, beautiful campus and amazing school spirit! Couldn't have asked for a better place as a home away from home. I've been working hard & playing hard. Blacksburg is pretty isolated, but it's a nice place to be outdoors and explore!"
"For a tech school, the internet is awful especially in the dorms.  And the math department is not great."
Go Hokies! The food really depends on where you go and the internet is almost always horrible
Tech is honestly great! Wish it was not located in a small town tho
A great school that challenges you and helps you find connections and real life experience. 
"I love it, but school can be difficult."
Great School
"I had a really hard time choosing between going to VT and JMU and I am forever grateful that I chose to go to Tech! I love it so much here in Blacksburg and the school, campus, and people are top notch. The school has a great atmosphere and I absolutely love the campus. It also has some of the best teachers and programs in the country. GO HOKIES!!"
I love this school so much. It truly is so amazing and offers so many opportunities for you. I've joined so many clubs and everyone wants everyone else to succeed unlike uva... LOVE TECH GO HOKIES 
Good school.
Campus is beautiful and the school is well renowned.
love it
good school
"The school is amazing. Has everything you could want and more, along with an amazing academic record. It is definitely not an easy school, especially as an engineering major, but totally worth it."
"I was a student for 2 years before transfer. Beautiful campus, big social life(useful for connections), but its in middle of nowhere so opportunities depending on major is slim, and not safe (imo) during freshman year I would receive emails about sexual assault cases almost everyday. Reputation of this school is doing down"
Amazing school
"I LOVE MY SCHOOL! But fr this is actually the best school ever. The prettiest campus you'll ever see, amazing dining halls, and great networking syetem. Hokeis love hiring hokies! Everyone is like a family <3 There are sm fun events planned like concerts and firework shows on the drill field. Highy highly recomend"
Love it here
"Overall, I really like Virginia Tech. I do have some friends here that haven't had the best experiences but I've met far more who are in love with the school and plan to stay for graduate programs. VT has great opportunities if you actually go out, be proactive ang get involved. It's a huge campus but the sense of family is definitely real here."
I like the school overall
Amazing University. Amazing People. Endless Opportunity.
Loved it at Virginia Tech my neighbor Sarah went there and she loved it so she recommended it to me and I love it here
Love it at Virginia Tech food is great great academics my neighbor Lilly went to Virginia Tech and when I was looking into colleges she brought it up so I took a look and it looked like a great place and it is highly recommend we live in New York so it is pretty far from us but worth it
"There aren't many common areas, not compared to my previous university. It is hard to find open spaces between classes and people are funny about sharing their spaces."
Great school!
VT was a wonderful experience. I would recommend building relationships with faculty and students early.
Just completed my first semester as a freshman and I could not be happier with my decision to attend tech. Go hokies!
First semester at Tech was awesome. Highly recommend.
GO HOKIES!!!!!
Best school
Good school
I LOVE TECH
Great all round
Very few complaints so far.
Beautiful campus. Some horrible teachers in counselor ed program. Bodenhorn is a nasty person and is known for humiliating her students. You get the impression that these 'teachers' have never counseled anyone.
Great School
"Not a top-tier university, although it is 4 hour drive to DC, the career opportunities are quit limited."
Great school with great campus and faculty
Great school to go to. Just come here!
So many opps. and great diverse people!!
Fum times
proud to be a hokie !
Virginia Tech is the most beautiful campus I've ever seen.
Anyone is super lucky to come here.
"I've been at Virginia Tech for two years and I have never been happier. The people are great and the campus is beautiful. My only negative is that the math department is almost universally disliked by students, regardless of major. Other than that, the school is wonderful and a great choice."
Beyond words
There's been a steady decline in all aspects of the university since I've been here. Tim Sands is running this university into the ground.
I love it here so much! I don't want to leave!
Great campus and people
I actually graduated in 1984 and wouldn't change a thing about a school that I saw for the first time at orientation.
Best school!
HOKIE NATION!!
"I do not like Virginia Tech because all I have noticed is how greedy the institution is making people pay ridiculous amounts for food, citations, parking permits, etc. They really milk all the money out of their students. Also, it is a big party school and very dangerous. There are many harassment reports and abuse due to drinking. Not nice people"
I could not imagine attending a college that's better than Virginia Tech! Gokies!
best school in VA and beat UVA
Overall Good School for STEM. Lots of opportunities.
"I was nervous about Tech, particularly because of its location. However, Tech is surrounded by gorgeous mountains and you come to find it charming. There are so many opportunities, but you have to look for them. Professors at Tech want you to succeed and are always happy to talk. People were not lying about the food. I'm so happy to be here."
I'm glad I transferred here. Go hokies!
