4.0,"The school is amazing. Teachers are exceptional, classes are challenging but resources are great, safety is decent but there are police everywhere, food is immaculate (expensive though), clubs are fun (go to clubs when making friends).

5.0,"Virginia Tech has something for everyone. It's big but feels small - like I always see friends when changing classes. Blacksburg is super homey and the nature surrounding it is AMAZING. Hiking spots, waterfalls, river swimming, bonfires, camping, is all within reach. I feel very safe on campus. It's 10/10 vibes, I don't even have to romanticize it",5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5

4.0,"Vt has an amazing rep,a diverse and balanced school, location is in the middle of nowhere, infinite opportunities, not enough facilities and common areas, great internet, 11/10 food, more than enough clubs, a diverse and balanced student population 11/10 social, location is not best so happiness goes down over time, safe place.",4,2,5,2,4,5,5,5,3,5
4.0,"dorm = 100 yr old shoebox
dining = many options+1/2 off with meal plan
professors = mostly helpful with a couple of outliers
on-campus parking for residents = 1 mile away from dorm

4.2,"Overall, Virginia Tech is a great environment to learn and make connections. ",5,5,5,3,3,4,5,5,4,3
4.9,"Fantastic school, saying I enjoyed my time there is an understatement. The quality of education it provides relative to the cost (at least in state) is hard to beat. You do have to be slightly proactive in seeking out office hours for large classes if you need help, but I never had difficulty getting assistance if I put the effort in. ",5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5

4.8,"Virginia Tech and Blacksburg, VA is an awesome combo - go hokies!",5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,5
4.9,I've personally had such a great experience. I had a bit of a tough time the first month freshman year because I'm not a super outgoing person and didn't know anyone but once I pushed myself to get out there and joined some clubs everything really turned around for me and I knew I made the best choice coming to VT. I also love Blacksburg in itself!,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5

4.7,"My only complaint would be the location cause it is a bit far from large cities but at the same time that's a highlight. The campus is great, and the sense of community is definitely present.

4.8,It's an awesome environment! ,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5
3.9,"I'm in VT's Mechanical Engineering Graduate program, which is a great program, but if you're looking for really 
top-shelf ambitious universities like Purdue, UMich, Penn State etc., it's probably a rung below that.
Social life is great for in-campus activities... but its location (Blacksburg, VA) is pretty remote, so not much to do outside campus.",4,2,4,5,4,4,3,4,4,5
4.2,i don't feel like elaborating but GO HOKIES (the wifi sucks tho),5,4,3,5,2,5,5,5,4,4
3.8,"Don't trust the Wi-Fi it doesn't work 90% of the time, you also have no service. ",5,2,5,3,1,5,5,4,4,4
4.4,"The city is built around the school so the everything in Blacksburg feels like it is apart of the school. Because everything is close and tight, you will get to know every local small business in here. The benefits you get is pretty solid too and had pretty good overall experience with the school.

4.9,"This school is the absolute best way to spend your four years in college. The foods amazing, there are countless study spots, our sports teams have really good crowds (even if they aren't playing so well), great club sports, easy to get involved in any of our countless clubs, greek life isn't overpowering just supplementary, and it bburgs gorgeous",5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5

4.4,"Great school! I love the location, coming from a small town where everything is spaced out this is a great location for a college town, everything you could need is super close in either Blacksburg or Christiansburg. 
The internet is HORRIBLE working on campus is almost impossible. I do wish they were better to transfer students.",5,5,5,4,1,5,4,5,5,5

4.4,"Well-respected school especially for engineering, great food, beautiful campus and amazing school spirit! Couldn't have asked for a better place as a home away from home.

3.4,"I was a student for 2 years before transfer. Beautiful campus, big social life(useful for connections), but its in middle of nowhere so opportunities depending on major is slim, and not safe (imo) during freshman year I would receive emails about sexual assault cases almost everyday.
