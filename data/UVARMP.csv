Review
"overrated, overpriced, snobby, but clean & the professors are devoted to students. 5/10"
food bad
"Best school in the world. I feel so grateful to be here every time I walk through Grounds. My favorite aspect is the work hard, play hard culture. Everyone here is an academic weapon, but knows how to have fun. "
"UVA is something truly special. Nestled in the heart of Charlottesville, it's surrounded by a town that's as welcoming as it is beautiful. Its mountain views and sense of community make it the perfect place to learn and grow. Students are challenged with top-tier academics while also embracing a vibrant social scene and a proud athletic tradition."
Very nice 
"Honestly, UVA is a paradise for me. I never knew I would love college as much as I've loved it here. I'm so sad to be graduating this spring."
LOVE UVA but the food needs so much work. Use the same food provider that Runk uses at the other 2 dining halls.
UVA is a great school!
It is the best place in the whole world; I am so thankful to go here. 
"I'm a transfer student but I would say coming to uva was one of the best decisions I've ever made. It's not perfect, but I've had fun and experiences here that I don't regret."
"Great experience through four years, friendly environment and plenty of opportunities."
definitely one of the schools of all time

"This was my dream school growing up and I have to say that it lived up to every expectation I had. It's competitive, but not in a bad way. The professors are great and really passionate about the subjects they teach. Not that it's perfect- no college is- but I've found lifelong friends and I wouldn't want to go anywhere else."
"It's not cheap at all for an out-of-state student, but it is worth every dollar. Everyone is very nice and supportive, and the social scene is great. Honestly, the only downsides are food and football, and everything past that is pretty solid. "
Don't come here for undergrad or any of the graduate schools. This is not a good place for your mental health.
"UVA is definitely over hyped and costs way too much for out of state students. Personally, I don't think the costs justify out of state, but in state makes some sense because at least your paying a little less. The engineering department is okay, but could definitely use a lot of improvement, and the math/science departments are awful. "
"The best school ever! Coolest location, gorgeous campus, amazing social opportunities, great academics, and fun sports. We get a bad reputation for being preppy and stuck up, but it's nowhere close to as bad as some make it seem. The food gets a lot of hate because it isn't ~amazing~ but it's totally fine and you'll find things you like. Go here!"
"I love this school, its a perfect mix of great opportunities, amazing professors, and a beautiful campus"
LOVE
No space for 2025 students but its awesome here.
Love UVA its awesome my cousin Mariah graduated from her 2 years ago and she loved it so do I its amazing campus
I like it at UVA its an awesome experience Im a sophomore this year at UVA and its awesome and my cousin Tatum is also here shes a Freshman and she also loves it here
"Decent reputation and location. I definitely recommend exploring off grounds. The environment is very competitive, so clubs and opportunities are not guaranteed (for decent ones at least). Everything is under construction or outdated. WiFi sucks. Literally got food poisoning at the dining halls. CAPS is so incredibly ineffective."
"Lots of clubs here, but it's hard to find them; not easy to meet people unless you do. The research/internship scene is VERY competitive but fruitful. Wifi is mostly stable. Many aren't loving it, but party to cope. Lots of stalking/prowling/assault incidents here, unfortunately. Overall, promising, but you have to work to have a good experience."
I went here to be close to family instead of Notre Dame. Worst decision of my life.
"I really like it, hard to make close friends at first but it all works out in the end plus there is A LOT of school spirit from current students and alums."
"always stuff to do both on and off grounds. dining food is terrible but cville has an excellent restaurant scene so branch out. profs are helpful, grading is hard but its a hard school. good time management and study skills are a must. its a big school so definitely get involved w clubs and put yourself out there"
great location with lots of things to do. teachers are pretty great and overall the students are happy. food could use some improvement
Love this school more than anything!
