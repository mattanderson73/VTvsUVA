How is the networking at uva for engineering? Is it difficult to get internships and how is name recognition amongst companies? For alumnis, although this is a best superficial question, was it easy to get a job coming out of college?

Where to attend for Computer science: purdue vs UVA vs UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1jq1uch/where_to_attend_for_computer_science_purdue_vs/,"I am having some trouble deciding where to go in the fall, as I have been admitted to all of these schools. For some context, I am from Virginia so I am in-state for UVA and OOS for the other two. I got admitted to UVA for arts and sciences, so it would cost me about **40k** per year. Purdue would cost about **47k** per year, and UMD would be about **50k** per year (I received a 12.5k per year scholarship). 

Before I weigh pros and cons, I want to focus on the cost. It is not really a huge factor for me as I did ask to switch into the Engineering school at UVA, and if they are able to switch me into that, then UVA would be about 50k per year making all of these schools relatively identical in price. Even if this switch does not happen, my top school was Georgia Tech (54k per year) and my parents were more than willing to pay for that, so while saving money is a definite pro in making this choice, it is not the end all be all.

**UVA Pros:**  
Campus is very close to home (1 hour drive) and a lot of my friends and people I know in general are going here. It would be very comfortable for me and I would not feel super out of place as I can make new friends yet also stick with old ones as well. I would attempt to double major in McIntire if I go here, and Cs + Business would look good and be helpful in the future and for recruiting (I think). The biggest pro is probably my father, he is a big fan of UVA and really wants me to attend. It's hard to try to convince him otherwise and he is set on this school and would be really happy if I go. I am not against UVA by any means, it is an amazing school, and if I went it would make my parents really comfortable and happy.

**UVA Cons:**  
Probably the weakest option for comp sci. I do not know how supportive the CS department here is, and whether or not the school is a real target for recruitment. I would have to grind a lot more here I believe, also McIntire admission is competitive now since it is a 3 year program so it is honestly a gamble of whether I even get into that. Also, I cannot specialize within CS at UVA, whereas at the other two options you can pick a specialty route (AI, cybersecurity, etc.)

**Purdue Pros:**  
Visited the campus on an admitted students event and honestly liked it. There are many opportunities here for research and looks like a lot of support from the CS department in general. I could easily double major in data science or AI as well. The program here seems a lot more project based and would help my resume, and I have heard from people that go there that there are a handful of tech companies that hire from Purdue. PurdueComputes is a relatively new thing that will combine the CS department with others. (like the engineering department), and engineering at Purdue is very very strong.

**Purdue Cons:**  
It is just so far away. Indiana is about a 10 hour drive and a 3 hour flight to Chicago followed by a 2 hour shuttle ride to campus. I don't know how comfortable I am moving in here. Also, I am interested in a living learning community called the Data Mine, but the priority housing for that is (I believe) April 15th, which is way too soon and would not be able to find a roommate on time.

**UMD Pros:**  
The school is in DC area which seems good for job placement, they are probably the highest ranked school out of these 3 for comp sci and they seem to also have some good opportunities and support from the school (CS is their most common major actually). It is a good balance of far away but not too far as it is about a 2 hour drive. I think I would get the most out of CS here

**UMD Cons:**  
I know absolutely nothing / nobody at this school. It seems like a big risk, I do have a tour coming up for it but I am not sure If I would like the campus / see myself at this school. Honestly, I couldn't tell you why. It just doesn't seem like the right fit for me. This is not the most solid piece of evidence, but honestly I never even considered the school until recently. Also, the housing application is due on the same day as the commitment deadline, so I would have to find a roommate sometime before May 1 and commit all at once which seems kind of soon idk. This school is the best option for CS but also seems like the most competitive as well. 

I may have forgotten a few things, but this is my general pros and cons. Overall I am just leaning toward UVA but I wanna make sure I am not losing out on solid opportunities at the other two schools. Also, I am posting this in the subreddits for each of the 3 schools so I can get an overall viewpoint on what others think and not just biased answers from just one school specifically.

Following are my questions:

1. Is it the project similar to Model-based Systems Engineering? I find many courses majoring in models.
2. What jobs may I have after I gain my master degree? Many reddits say that management consulting is a popular path.
3. Given that UVA is not in a large city, is it possible for me to find a suitable internship during my study?

I really want to live close to Grounds and the Corner, places like Wertland and GrandMarc are great examples of what I want.

The problem is that, as a transfer, everything is so last-minute and has short deadlines. I applied through the GAA and feel confident about my acceptance, but decisions don’t come out until around April 26. Meanwhile, on-Grounds housing applications open on May 1, and I doubt I’ll get a spot if I wait since it’s not guarantees and you’re putting off accepting off grounds housing as you wait. If I wait off for my acceptance and miss out on on-Grounds housing, I’ll be scavenging last-minute to find a place, and that place proboly won’t fit my wants/needs as it’s so late in comparison to non transfers.

What’s the best move here? How have past transfers handled this? I’m looking for a place near the Corner/Grounds with my own room and roommates who are clean, respectful, and social. Any advice would be really helpful!

I also got into UMich but ultimately decided the UVA is a better fit for me despite it being not as highly ranked (idk if this is a stupid decision but I've heard its what you do not where you go). I have a few question about UVA. 

1. How possible is it to major across schools, for example being in the engineering school and also majoring in Econ, I have AP credit from seven classes so idk if this will help or not 

2. How easy is it to get into the school of data science or Mcntire because I may want to do these just not sure yet. 

3. How much time do I really have to shop around before deciding on a major, I am very indecisive adn although I think I know what to do i am not sure 

4. This is not UVA related but is it actually not possible to do engineering with a mac and I have one thats only 1.5 years old and do not want to buy another expensive computer 

5. How are the research and internship oppurtunities at UVA, are they easy to get if you look for them or is it very hard to find things to do outside the classroom

 6. How rigorous really is UVA, hwo long do people really spend on homework 

7. Is it very clique and do most people come with friends from high school, I am an oos student adn know no body going, on the same note do most people go home for the weekends or are there still things to do

 8. How big are class sizes at UVA, is it possible to really know your professors or not really, or do you have to go far out of your way to get to know your teachers 

9. Is study abraod a thing that is acccessbile to engineering majors 

10. What is the weather like, I am from NJ so I am assuming its warmer then here but idk how much warmer 

11. Are alumni connections very helpful in finding a job, and how is the job placement, is it very hard to compete with top engineering schools, such as UMich, or not really. 

12. Do alot of people go to sports games or not really and is it free/easy to get tickets 

13. Is greek life a big part of the school because I do not think I want to participate but I do not want to feel like I can't have fun with out it

UVA vs Umich,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1jojodm/uva_vs_umich/,"Hi everyone, I'm debating between attending UVA or Umich. I'm looking to study mechanical engineering. Here's a list of the pros/cons.

UVA

Pros
- In State
- Full ride in aid and scholarships 
- Hour away (can come home whenever)
- Get to spend time with my family
I feel like some of the negatives are maybe UVAs engineering program which is good but isn't really notable in terms of national ranking. I also feel id be missing out on seeing the world by staying in the same state and hanging around the same people.

Umich
I don't exactly know my aid package yet but I can expect around 70-80 % of my costs covered.
-Better than UVA for all majors especially engineering.
-Large Muslim Community 

Cons- 
- I'd miss my family and gf
- may put my self in a little debt.

i have a good handle of what my life would look like at w&m because it is smaller and naturally more my style. however, i was wondering if anyone on here could attest to what it is like to be an introverted uva student who does not go to many parties or engage in greek life. everyone from my school that has gone to uva fits the stereotypical uva mold -- white, popular, work hard play hard, a little pretentious -- and i have really struggled finding someone similar to me.

  
some starting questions:

* were you still able to find 'your' people?
* do you feel like you are missing out by not going to parties and sporting events?
* is there fun stuff to do besides sports, drinking, and partying?
* do you have to participate in greek life to feel connected?

My Time,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1jn3jns/my_time/,"This place is so incredibly lonely. I walk around and see people laughing with their friends, walking in groups, eating together, talking before class, and I wish I could know what that feels like. I’ve been here for nearly two years, and I’ve never once felt like I belonged. I tried in the beginning. I talked to people in classes, sat with others in the dining hall, joined QSU, and even looked through the club website hoping something would catch my eye. But nothing piqued my interest or felt like a space I could see myself in. Now that I’m heading into my third year, it feels like the window to make connections has already closed. Everyone has their own circles and I am just alone. I go home every weekend because being on Grounds is too painful. At least when I am home, I do not have to constantly see how much better everyone else seems to have it.

As a first-generation, low-income, gay, mixed student, I do not fit in here. The environment feels cliquey, pretentious, and cold, and I have never felt welcome. I chose UVA because it gave me the best financial aid, and even though I had a horrible gut feeling about this place when I toured in high school, I hoped I was wrong. But two years later, nothing has changed. I am still sad every day. I spend most of my time in my dorm room because no one talks to me or wants me around.

People love to assume I am not trying or that I am exaggerating, but I really did try. I am not a troll, and I am not looking for attention. I am someone who is genuinely suffering here and feels completely alone. No one understands what it’s like to walk through this school day after day without a single person to talk to. No one checks in. No one notices. It feels like no one cares, and honestly, they probably don’t. I am not asking for advice or a solution. Just needed to vent.",0,23,1743304533.0

UVA could be next,https://i.redd.it/frc7srxzddre1.jpeg,"This is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student who had a legal student visa to study at Tufts university. She was a full bright scholarship who was getting her PhD. 

She was recently detained by ICE and sent from Massachusetts to a Louisiana ICE detention center. 

There is video evidence of what happened to her. In the video, several masked policeman grabbed her and forced her into a vehicle. For the next few hours until she reached Louisiana, her attorney was unable to locate her. 

They stated her visa was revoked because of “terrorist activities”. The terrorist activities in question? Last year she co-wrote an editorial for her school newspaper asking for peace for Palestinians. She wrote things such as “We affirm the equal dignity and humanity of all people” and she urged people to take a close look at the issue. 

I’ve seen people complain about these types of posts on this sub saying that if it happened at another university then why should we care? What does it have to do with UVA? 

Well firstly we don’t need to be a Tufts student or a Columbia student to care about these types of issues. We just need to be human. And secondly, we would have to be naive to think UVA is somehow untouchable. We need to stay aware and alert. We need to look out for those around us. Even if you believe that this issue is too big to tackle (which I mean come on, political majors are some of the most popular at  UVA. Why back down now?? Practice what you preach!), at the very least what you can do is stand in solidarity. To show that UVA is a college that stands up against this type of bull crap. 

The only thing I would say be cautious about is voicing things if you’re an immigrant. Rumeysa was detained for writing an editorial. Please be careful if you’re an immigrant and you want to participate in politics.",765,184,1743141285.0

"Ok, but how actually competitive is an a-school intra-transfer",https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1jk9pu4/ok_but_how_actually_competitive_is_an_aschool/,"Hi y’all,

So I’m a first year that submitted my A-School transfer application this past February for Fall 2025. I’m confident that I have given it my all, and I recognize the only thing I can really do is sit here and wait.

The only thing that worries me is what Tashana Starks, the director of admissions and academic support, has told me: the transfer is competitive because of the program size.

My only thing is that I don’t really get what this specific characteristic differs from like the typical college app competition… like look at the UVA undergrad admissions app acceptance rate: 18-20%??? Extremely competitive since most apps just get tossed out (and also like it benefits the entire “prestigious” status quo too). It’s not hard to see why since like a ridiculous amount of people apply for this school.

Though, it’s not like people are clamoring their fists in their sleep to become the next Frank Lloyd Wright. To be honest, I actually have zero idea how many people transfer to the a-school and especially within my specific circumstances of being first year spring semester.

I guess a reap ratio would be nice. Like “Oh, 20/45 people that applied were taken in” type of statistic. 

I think what all this boils down to is that waiting two months on results is pretty nerve wracking, and I just can’t help but think about these things.

Thanks y’all lmaoo

Letter from UVA’s Brie Gertler about tomorrow’s walkout,https://i.redd.it/kqatlxyewwqe1.jpeg,"Text of the letter:

“Dear members of the faculty and other instructors,

It has come to my attention that there has been a call by several organizations for a walkout on central Grounds at 11:30 tomorrow (Wednesday, March 26th), with some students beginning on North Grounds at 11:10. I understand that you are scheduled to teach at that time, and I am writing to make sure that you are aware of this and to provide some guidance about how to respond if one or more of your students chooses to participate in the walkout.

Promoting free expression and free inquiry on Grounds is core to our mission and integral to who we are, and it is not a violation of University policy for a student to walk out of a class, so long as they do so peacefully and without disrupting the class. At the same time, walking out of (or being absent from) class may have academic consequences for students, depending on the existing class attendance policies established by the instructor or school.

Instructors are obligated to protect the free speech rights of students in academic situations such as classes, where instructors have a designated institutional role and corresponding authority and responsibilities. Please keep in mind that instructors bear this obligation to every student, regardless of the student's opinions about the walkout or the issues related to it.

Our commitment to protect expressive activity lives alongside our commitment to our educational mission, and all Wednesday classes should be held as scheduled.

Information about protests, demonstrations, and gatherings on University property is available at freespeech.virginia.edu. If you receive questions from your students about University policies, I encourage you to direct them to this resource.

Best,

Brie Gertler

Drexel (Full Ride) vs. UVA ($8.7K/yr) for Finance — Is McIntire Worth the Risk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1jizamu/drexel_full_ride_vs_uva_87kyr_for_finance_is/,"Hey everyone—looking for some real advice from current students or alumni who know the ins and outs of UVA and McIntire.

I’m choosing between:
	
•	Drexel University: I received a full-ride scholarship (Liberty Scholars Program). I’d major in Finance and take advantage of their nationally recognized co-op program, which is ranked #2 in the country for internships/co-ops (right after Northeastern). I’d graduate debt-free with 18 months of paid work experience on my resume. Drexel has strong ties in Philly (where I’m from), and students often land well-paying corporate finance and wealth management roles quickly after graduation.
	
•	UVA: I was admitted and based on need, I’d pay around $8.7K per year (so ~$35K total). I’m really interested in the McIntire School of Commerce—I know it’s top-tier for finance and a known feeder for investment banking and consulting. But I’d have to apply to McIntire after freshman year (60% acceptance rate for UVA students). That uncertainty is stressing me out. If I don’t get in, I feel like my finance career would be at a disadvantage.

	•	Is McIntire worth the cost and risk?
	•	How do UVA students view Drexel—especially knowing their internship/co-op setup is so strong?
	•	Would you roll the dice for McIntire or lock in a debt-free degree with experience?

Thanks in advance—trying to make the smartest long-term choice.

This morning my roommate (26F) physically attacked me (31M). I'm mostly okay but I'm scared, because even though I got the start of it on video and the police acknowledged it was indeed her assaulting me, the only protection that I have is a 72-hour protective order that I'm going to get extended, and she's bragged before about how she can get away with whatever she wants since I wouldn't be taken seriously as a man. I just didn't really believe her until now since I was told by the officers that I could try and press assault charges but that since she has no priors the end results would be the same, and that I would be stuck paying the court costs in the end. She's threatened my life more than once but I never got it recorded so I guess that doesn't hold weight, and now I believe that she has it in her to actually try. 

I don't have options to go somewhere else and I don't really have any friends close enough to me that I feel comfortable asking if I can stay there for a while. After I posted on here about my issues with food and saw the massive support you guys were able to provide I was hoping there might be some law students or a group or something that could hear my story and see if it's really pointless to press charges or not?

I rely on my fafsa and aid to cover most of on-grounds housing rates, and it’s nice because it’s the cost of just the academic year and fixed. So it’s ideal to do off-grounds. 
However, I don’t think it can cover a 12 month lease off-grounds. I have practically no experience or knowledge on how leasing works, and I feel lost especially that the semester is ending soon. I know I have to work more if I choose off-grounds but I’m uncertain if I can make ends meet and also maintain my gpa and coursework. (I wish to maintain it well for grad school.) My parents can’t help me with paying housing at all they can’t afford it. 
Quick background: my tuition is covered by the uva access grant, Pell grant + state aid cover most on-grounds housing rates and only have to pay the remaining ~1,000 for the academic year and used part of my loans to cover that.

UVA Culture & Other Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1jcqtag/uva_culture_other_questions/,"I got into UVA (yay me), BUT I have some questions about the school.

1. What is the culture here like? Like I know that it’s vaguely similar to UPenn wherein students are expected to do a LOT of work but also have fun. I’m interested in the fun part because I spent a lot of the last four years working hard in high school. What are the freshman year events you would suggest I take part in? What did you wish you do your freshman year?

2. Is the dating scene for gay men bad? This question was asked a few times in the past and I know the answer is probably yes but I’m reserving hope 🥺🥺

3. Are Econ students frat bros? I’ll probably major in Econ and try to get into McIntire but I’m worried that the other students in my major will be mean because I’m gay. Ik it’s 2025 but at my state school finance/business/people majoring in money are notoriously homophobic. 

4. Ill need to work a part time job to afford tuition since my parents have saved very little and I’ve heard nightmares about taking out private loans. Do you think being an Econ student while working 25-35 hours a week is doable if you’re aiming for a GPA of 3.5+? 

5. I’m super nervous about making friends ☹️. At my school everyone thinks of me as the kid who works super hard and a “teachers pet.” i’m super cool with my coworkers at burger king but they’re dull so it’s easy to have fun with them. Maybe I’m an elitists

6. Is elitism real here?

McBurney Leaving?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1jc0k2f/mcburney_leaving/,"Looking at the course listings for next semester, it seems like Professor McBurney is not teaching anything next semester. This is unfortunate, particularly in light of **[a Reddit post](https://web.archive.org/web/20241117232629/https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gqv4vc/teaching_computer_science_in_the_age_of_gippity/)** made in November by someone who sounds suspiciously like McBurney. In the post, the author details his (many) complaints with his school's CS program, and states that he's decided to move to a different school.

I would encourage everyone to read the whole post, since it gives an idea of how CS students at UVA are seen by professors. Here are some selected quotes.

> **Students actively encourage each other to not try.** ""I got an A, and I never went to class or read a page"" is such a common gloat at our university, and it's created a toxic space where students who truly are well behind where they should be seem to believe that this is a viable path to success - do nothing, whine when you don't get an A, and blame everyone but the person responsible, themself.

#

> **I routinely see students, who got an A in both prior classes who cannot write a for loop to sum a list of numbers.** They don't understand the idea of ""mutability"" (that is, the value of a variable is able to vary), and despite having done an object oriented language for an entire course, they can't explain what a class, instance, constructor, method, etc. are when they arrive in my class.

#

> All exams are now pencil and paper because **they all cheat all the time on everything**. And even then, on paper and pencil exams, we constantly have to move students because of copying.

#

> **My ultimate view, seeing college students today, is that I will never trust anymore doing a job who was born after 2000.** Not because there aren't great students (I had my two best students ever last year during all of these problems I mentioned), but because **the majority are utterly, completely, and proudly incompetant, cheating their way to a degree**.

It doesn't sound like the UVA administration is any better, with the author stating that

> **We have multiple faculty meetings each semester interrupted by the Associate Vice Dean of Hurt Feelings and Vending Machine Services come in and tell us how we're all bad at our job because we aren't inflating grades fast enough.** I'm not joking. Last week we saw a graph about how we used to have X average GPA, and peer institution also had X average GPA, but now we're only X + 0.2, and they managed to be X + 0.4. So we need to look at ways of ""boosting grades"", including ""creative opportunities to students to show mastery"" (i.e., shut the fuck up and give them an A)

#

> **Last year, I had complaints that only, on average, 40% of students in my classes got A's.** That I really need to bump that number up to 50% or 60%, because other faculty have managed to get their numbers up that high (surely through sound teaching methods and effective tutoring, and not just changing the formula).

#

> **My job now, if admins had their way, is to simply sign a piece of paper saying ""this student is entitled to a high starting salary""**, adding them to the pile of hundreds of thousands of students angry at us that Google and Amazon won't hire someone that doesn't know what a hash map is.

I think everyone can agree that these quotes paint a pretty terrible view of UVA's CS program, its students, and the administration in general. If McBurney is indeed leaving, I'll be sad to see him go, and I wish him luck at his next institution.",98,25,1742060350.0

So I'm a first year prospective physics major and I really enjoyed physics in high school, so I decided to major in it here. It's 2nd semester and I just don't feel that same love for physics that I once did. The professors kinda suck because it's like they're teaching to their colleagues and not actual first year students in an intro-class. I also feel like most ppl in my intro classes have been studying physics for YEARS, and are absolutely obsessed, so it makes me feel so behind in my knowledge. People keep telling me to stick it out but I'm not sure. I'm decent at calculus and physics but not like A+ level where I'm acing the exams. I got a 76 on my Physics midterm and did terrible on my calc midterm. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice or if they felt similar when they first started majoring in Physics and what you did about it? 

I've been seriously thinking about switching majors because I want to major in something I even semi-enjoy you know? I still like physics but I just feel like I'm not getting it to the extent everyone else is. Not to compare myself, I just truly think you need a specific type of brain for physics that I thought I was developing until I met these wicked smart kids.

Jim Ryan addresses DEI cuts,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1j9iafd/jim_ryan_addresses_dei_cuts/,"Haven't seen this posted here yet; Jim Ryan's response to UVA dissolving the DEI office:

Dear UVA Community,

As you may have read, the Board of Visitors last Friday presented and subsequently adopted a resolution to dissolve the central Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) office and to move legally permissible programs within that office to another organizational home within the University.  Our central DEI office houses several important functions, including the Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights, Title IX compliance, the UVA Tribal Liaison, and the University’s Center for Community Partnerships.  In accordance with the resolution, we will take a look at the functions of the office and determine where they—and the positions that support them—should be housed.

Pursuant to federal and state directives, over the last month or so, we have also been reviewing our policies and practices to make sure they do not run afoul of any federal or state anti-discrimination laws.  Those conversations will continue with a focus on ensuring we are complying with the law and doing the very best work we can.

As the Board recognized in its resolution, our diversity makes us a stronger community, and it is a foundational value of this University.  I could not agree more.  In addition, the work of fostering an inclusive environment and a culture of opportunity for everyone remains as important as ever.  Making all community members feel welcome and ensuring all have an opportunity to succeed is work that occurs all across Grounds, day in and day out – from Admissions to Athletics to Alumni Hall, and from our residence halls to our classrooms, labs, and clinics.  That vital work will continue.

Last, and especially to our students, I hope this goes without saying, but I will say it anyway: all of you deserve to be here and belong here.  It does not matter where you are from or what you believe, your background, identity, or political orientation.  You are all a crucial part of this incredibly diverse and extraordinarily talented and compassionate community, something you all have in common.  My colleagues and I will continue to work as hard as we can to make sure you have every chance to succeed and to give back to this community, and for this University to continue to feel like home, for everyone.

Best,

Jim

Doing hard things risking failure vs easy things and guaranteeing success,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1j9e9c5/doing_hard_things_risking_failure_vs_easy_things/,"Basically I'm wondering if anyone can knock some sense into my head and wether this strong internal belief is in line with reality.

The belief being: It's better for you to attempt hard things and fail than attempting easy things knowing you'll succeed.

I ask this because I finally started questioning this ""way of life"" I've had ever since growing resentful back in high school after not taking a single AP class until taking like my first batch senior year (6 of them). Due to some miracle, I did better than I have ever in my previous ""easier"" years.

Now comes college. I find my self holding the same belief, take 19 credits and risk your GPA (and very likely hood the odds are stacked against) is something my ego, rational, whatever, believes is worth the risk.

Do I not realize how important my GPA is for grad school? Why am I being foolish? I could easily keep my GPA high by taking a normal load semester, but I strongly despise doing that for whatever reason.

Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1j7zdy5/help/,"Hello. I’m currently a first year at UVA and i’m currently going through a situation. I am a first generation student who only has one parent, my mom. I have never truly had a good relationship with her and when i got home for spring break, two days in i was kicked out. I am currently experiencing homelessness and want to go back to my dorm. 

I do have more concerns though. I’m worried about my financial aid. Now uva did provide me enough money but now with my situation i’m not sure what to do. I did my FASFA earlier this year when i was talking to my mom but now the aid office wants me to submit a tax form from my mom. I’m unable to do this. I want to claim myself as an independent but i’m not sure how to go about that. 

Now with that being said, i do have a pet cat who as well got kicked out with me. I’m not sure how i can get an SDAC accommodation.

Advice on UVA vs CWRU,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1j7z6zw/advice_on_uva_vs_cwru/,"Hi UVA community,

I haven't had a chance to visit either campus, however both Case and UVA are very appealing to me. UVA is in-state, however from Financial Aid they will both cost the same! - I'm having a hard time deciding and was wondering if you guys (who already study at UVA) could advise me for which school I should choose.

I feel like UVA has a bit more prestige/""name"" however CWRU is still a great school that has name recognition for my major.

I will be majoring in Electrical Engineering and feel like both schools will have the same quality of education. Both Cleveland and Charlottesville have their own ups and downs, so that won't make a big difference either.

Out of a college experience, I'm mainly looking for an academic environment with high quality students, faculty, professors, etc. I want to surround myself with like-minded people and generally am not interested in party-culture. However, I also want to go to a school which the students are proud of attending and their isn't a ""toxic"" environment. Lastly, I want my college environment to be structured so I can easily get opportunities and make full use of the location I live in (hopefully making life-long memories).

From you guys already studying at UVA, and know how it is, I was wondering if you guys could suggest why/or why not I should/shouldn't attend UVA over Case or vice versa.

Thank you, in advance!!!",0,3,1741615023.0

My department basically forces everyone to take PTO if you’re not at work.

So some examples would be if you’re sick and out of PTO are you able to take that time off without pay? Are there consequences to certain amount of time off without pay days? 

Or even if you do have plenty of PTO and will be late to work or want to leave early a couple hours can you take this time without using PTO?

My parents are seeking to have me transfer to VCU, since I’m from Richmond and all of my family went there. I’m not sure if it’s the right idea or not. I seek an asynchronous college experience, for I like to keep busy (I have both adhd, and autism) and I want to go straight into engineering work experience and possibly even field-work. I feel VCU will have much more financial aid, especially if I do honors. They also are more accommodating for learning disabilities. My only downfalls, are that I don’t want to live with my family, and I don’t really want to be part of the Richmond community either. I seek the degree and knowledge from higher education, but I’m just not big on social life. I have a partner I love here at UVA and can easily visit from VCU, and that’s all I have much yearn for. I just want to do online asynchronous learning so I can get as much education as possible, and go straight to grad or the work force.

I'm a senior in high school who recently got accepted into UVA's College of Engineering. I intend to major in Computer Science, but I want to supplement my education with a minor in finance so that I can work at FinTech after I graduate. (Basically, I want to learn the logistics of finance/business so that I can possibly critique the projects I'm given as a software engineer and potentially gain enough experience to start my own business long in the future.) However, UVA doesn't seem to have an outright ""finance"" minor - which minor at UVA would best fit this category?

Looking at College of Engineering minors, ""Engineering Business Minor"" caught my eye as it says, ""If you're interested in working in product management or engineering, as well as building businesses in technology-centric industries, this minor is for you."" However, I noticed that McIntire School of Commerce has minors available to all UVA students. Considering the fact that UVA is well known for its business and finance majors, I'm unsure if going this route is a better idea. One thing I'm wary about is a question that is asked when applying to the Engineering Business Minor that says: ""Are you already enrolled in the Entrepreneurship Minor? (If so, you may not be able to earn both the Engineering Business and Entrepreneurship Minors.)"" I'm assuming if I pick one, then I can't pivot to the other.

If anyone could provide insight into these minors and what would work best for me, that would be much appreciated.",2,3,1740704199.0

When I googled the same thing for UVA the first thing I saw was a Reddit post saying that UVA CS students are not feeling as prepared. Is this true? 

I’m leaning toward UNC but want to hear what you guys think is better because I may be wrong. ",5,8,1740612529.0

Am I screwed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1iwxghk/am_i_screwed/,"Hello, I am currently in community college, and of course we do not exactly have the best teachers, and I am trying to transfer to UVA under Computer Science. I am currently taking Calculus I and it is under my understanding that I am going to need to understand calculus to thrive in this degree field...

The problem is, is not only do I have a learning deficiency, which although surprisingly I do enjoy learning calculus, as I approach it like one big chess game, it is difficult for me to grasp most concepts and takes me far longer than the normal student. My precalc teachers were excellent with guiding me through the steps and making sure to understand it... my calculus teacher however takes a different approach.

She will cover two entire extensive chapters in 30 minutes and then dismiss class, when class ends in 1 hour and 30 minutes after she initially dismissed it. When I say that I need help and I am behind she says to just catch up and nobody learns like me. She actively penalizes me against my IEP.

It goes without saying that I am grasping quite literally 0 understanding in this class, the last thing we have covered are derivatives and I don't understand how to calculate those beyond 3x\^2 +5x - 20... kinda hyperbole kinda not. Of course this makes me angry, I am here to learn and I want to learn, but with all of the work and lack of support I feel like I have to go through any means necessary to survive. I need to keep my grades up, I quite literally can not afford to get below an A in this class.

My overall question is does UVA have better teachers than this? I understand that I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to take multivariate calculus after this, however my community college does not offer such class so I'll be taking that on campus... eventually. Are teachers here more understanding and empathetic? I understand I'll be put at an even bigger disadvantage due to this on top of the disadvantage my fucked brain has imposed on me but idk it is what it is, I have to pass this class, I just have to roll with what I've been served at the moment.",4,22,1740386255.0

Possible Transfer Questions..,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1itqavy/possible_transfer_questions/,"Hi guys

I'm currently a college freshman from VA who is attending an out of state school. I don't really mind the school I'm currently at and I'm doing well here but UVA has always been at the back of mind (obviously since its much cheaper and an excellent school). As soon as I was rejected initially in my senior year I planned on transferring but then dropped the idea after visiting my current school and being happy with it. For some reason I'm once again feeling drawn to UVA, mostly since its so much closer to home and I have some close friends who go there.

I have a 3.76 GPA right now (though its only been 1 semester) and have taken some pretty tough classes. To be honest I haven't really done any noteworthy extracurriculars in my time here. My high school performance overall would probably be classified as ""pretty decent"", I had a 4.1 GPA or something like that. My goal would be to transfer directly into McIntire, though I'm not sure if I should aim for an immediate transfer or wait another year (as, again, I am fine where I'm currently at).

I don't want to ask for a generic ""chance me"" as I understand it is completely situational, more so I'm curious if y'all think I should wait a year or just apply now if I have a good chance.

Mass layoffs affecting recent grads,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1itfb9f/mass_layoffs_affecting_recent_grads/,"UVA is a big feeder for careers in public service. I personally lost my job because of the layoffs and cuts happening in the federal government, and I’m seeing a lot of friends and fellow UVA recent grads affected on LinkedIn.

I feel for fellow recent grads who just started their career and now have lost their job. I honestly don’t know what to do myself. Many of us spent years planning to get to where we are just to lose it all. 

And for some of us, it’s not like we can easily find a new job. The international development sector in particular has been decimated and the federal government is being dismantled.

I was wondering what classes somebody who's in chem right now or graduated from chem took, a quick rundown or a full course list of what to take would be super helpful. 

Q- I have a 5 for AP chem credit, should i skip the CHEM 1810, 1811, 1820, 1821 track and go straight to CHEM 2810, 2811, 2820? 

I'm really interested in sciences and I do well on STEM subjects. I'm in a Organic Chemistry class at my highschool and it comes pretty natural to me with little memorization, so course rigor isn't an issue. I want to take the ""hardest"" track.

I'm also curious when I should get my gen ed credits done.

Missing Cat?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1is3lyk/missing_cat/,"Not sure where to post this, so I thought Reddit may be of help. I saw a gray and white cat at the bottom of the stairs outside Nau Hall that lead to Gaston. Didn’t seem feral at all, in fact very happy to see my friend and I. The cat then walked with us a little towards Gaston but stayed around the side of Nau. For clarification on the stairs, they’re the ones that you come across when you leave New Cabell Hall on the backside, walk across the bridge that goes over the road, and go down Nau on the right side under the arches. The cat was at the bottom of those stairs.
